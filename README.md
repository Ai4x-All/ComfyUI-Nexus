# Getting Shareable URL

Use Ngrok or any other tunneling software supporting http/https to Host a Global Server. Also you can host locally over wifi/lan.  

### Getting Url Port 
Open Comfyui in your browser:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b430d5b7-dcb9-4a7f-948f-d257147b597a)

In your url tab, Last digits after Colon is your port.   

  
Example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82ff2d9e-9eb6-4846-97c6-e3e321101fef)

The port for the above url will be **8188**


## Method 1) Remote Access - To Obtain Global Shareable Link

### Ngrok Setup: 

- Go to this https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup?ref=home-hero to sign up.
- After signing up and logging in, go to this https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows to set up ngrok.
- After installing and setting up ngrok,
- Run CMD and enter this command: `ngrok http <port>`

  ![Ngrok Output Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66f9b4a4-1d63-4756-8d57-64420fdc151a)
  ![Ngrok URL Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075613e2-d3f0-4a9d-b844-dc06f3c4adf3)

- "Forwarding" is the Remote Url, Share this url with your peers.


## Method 2) Local Wifi/Lan Url: 

### Using Your IP Address to Host Server

- Open a cmd and write `ipconfig`.

  ![ipconfig Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/043f2d9b-eccd-46cb-a333-ec483222b6d4)


- Now copy this address. For example, if it's `http://192.168.1.45:<comfy_port>`, the final URL will be: `http://192.168.1.45:5000`


> Ngrok and WiFi address will change if you restart the machine. Follow above steps again to get the new url.
